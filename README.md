## [Play on itch.io](https://catinthedark.itch.io/orbtris)
## [Entry on ldjam.com](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/49/orbitris)

### Controls

* **A/D** (Left/Right arrows): Rotate piece
* **W** (Up arrow): Accelerate
* **S** (Down arrow): Decelerate

### How to play

Place tetraminos just like in normal Tetris. Any row or column will disappear, if you fill it up to the GREY square. Fun thing is that sometimes you can score more than 4 lines at once!

If any block sticks out of RED square bounds, itâ€™s a game over!

### Tips & Tricks

Gameplay might seem hard for someone due to counter-intuitivety of the orbital mechanics. Using this simple trick, you can aim your pieces precisely! (I wanted to add this help into the game, but ran out of time):

1) Select the position where you want to put your next piece, and ACCELERATE to raise your orbit above this position

2) When your piece is above the desired position, DECELERATE: tut2.png

3) And it's done!
